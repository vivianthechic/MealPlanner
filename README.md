# MealPlanner
## Problem
College students are too busy with school and work to plan meals ahead of time, and often end up skipping meals or buying unhealthy food for meals. Students need to eat better to maintain a healthy diet, which would boost their energy that would in turn help with their workload. As college students, money also tends to be tight, so planning meals ahead of time can help save money by not having to buy food from outside restaurants.
## Solution
This app gives users the ability to plan out future meals on their smartphone and to keep track of groceries at home. Users can plan out meals in advance on specific days with our calendar feature. The app also allows users to discover new recipes, search for specific recipes, and save them for easy access in a "starred recipes" tab. Users can input their current grocery inventory, and create a shopping list when items run out. This gives students a motivation to think about the food they are eating and can inspire them to eat healthier. It can assist managing their time and money more efficiently by knowing how much time goes into preparing and cooking food, and spending less on outside food.
