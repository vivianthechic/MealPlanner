# MealPlanner
## Problem
College students are too busy with school and work to plan meals ahead of time, and often end up skipping meals or buying unhealthy food for meals. Students need to eat better to maintain a healthy diet that could help boost their energy that would in turn help with their workload. As college students, money also tends to be tight, so planning meals ahead of time can help save money by not having to buy food from outside restaurants.
## Solution
This app will provide users the option to plan out future meals on their smartphone, and will be able to keep track of what groceries are needed and are available at home. Users can plan out meals a week in advance and update grocery inventory. The app suggests new recipes based on users' tastes, diets, or inventory, and will notify users when certain inventory is low. This gives students accessibility and ease to plan out their meals without having to go home and check whatâ€™s in their fridge to see what they need to buy. It gives students a motivation to think about the food they are eating and can motivate them to eat healthier. It can help manage their time and money much more efficiently by knowing how much time goes into preparing and cooking food, and spending less to go out to eat.
